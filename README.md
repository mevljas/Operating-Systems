Faculty subject Operating Systems.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
### Lectures
Introduction  
Background  
Computer systems overview  
Operating systems overview  
Processes  
Process description and control  
Threads  
Concurrency: mutual exclusion, synchronization,  
deadlock, and starvation  
Memory  
Memory management  
Virtual memory  
Scheduling  
Uniprocessor scheduling  
Multiprocessor and real-time scheduling  
Input/output and files  
I/O management and disk scheduling  
File management  
### Tutorials
Selected topics from the lectures will be further
discussed. Presented concepts will be practically
demonstrated in OS Linux and Bash scripting language.
A student will have to work on a number of tutorial
assignments and homeworks.
## Objectives and competences
The main objective of the course is to understand the
purpose of the OS in the computer system, its
connection to HW and user SW. Students understand
the concepts behind each OS part, which implement the
concept of process, memory management, scheduling
and I/O management, also from the practical point of
view.
### General competences
- Developing skills in critical, analytical and synthetic
thinking.
- The ability to understand and solve professional
challenges in computer and information science.
- The ability to apply acquired knowledge in
independent work for solving technical problems in
computer and information science; the ability to
upgrade acquired knowledge.
Subject specific competences:
- Basic skills in computer and information science, which
includes basic theoretical skills, practical knowledge and
skills essential for the field of computer and information
science.
### Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding
Beside declarative knowledge about structure and
execution of OS, the focus is on understanding basic
parts from the practical point of view.
### Application
Knowing the architecture of OS, possibility of changing
it, adding upgrades. Evaluation of different algorithms in
the context of specific real problems.
### Reflection
Student knows parts of the OS, relations between them,
and connections with HW and user SW. Student realizes
the harmony between the theoretical explanation and
practical application.
### Transferable skills
OS is a foundational SW of each computer system. By
understanding basic concepts we build strong
foundations for upgrade of functionality of the
computer system.
